# IMDB DATA ANALYSIS

This project served as an opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills in data analysis. The primary objectives were to practice data cleaning and visualization techniques, which had not been previously explored. Leveraging tools such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I obtained the dataset of IMDb Top 1000 Movies and performed data cleaning to the best of my abilities. Upon cleaning the data, I conducted basic analysis and visualization to derive meaningful insights.

Based on extensive research into real-world questions and a thorough review of the CSV file, I established specific research questions to guide the analysis. Through this project, I demonstrate an understanding of data cleaning, visualization, and data analysis as a whole, further augmenting my proficiency in this field.
